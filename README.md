Snapchat streak but for Discord, it keeps users active by giving them a streak point each day.

This provides a way for the community to compete in the leaderboard for the most streaks in their server and globally.

It's very good for server owners if they want to give prizes to their most active users.

*The minimum word count for streak by default is 100, this can be changed by server owner using ``!threshold (amount)``.*

Streak days are reset at 00:05 Midnight GMT, and your streak will be reset to 0 if you don't reach the minimum word count.

Commands:

- ``!streak (me|@user|userID)``

- ``!info``

- ``!threshold (amount)`` (for server owners only, sets the minimum words for a streak server-wide)

- ``!streak (optional: me|global|@user|username)``

Achievements have been added to the profile summary (see below).

``!streak`` with no arguments will display the leaderboard for the current server and only the top 25 active users will be displayed. ``!info`` will provide small summary of the rules and any extra info.
